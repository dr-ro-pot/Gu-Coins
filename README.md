# Gu-Coins
Gu coin is a reddit currency 

Q:How much Gu-coins do i have?

A: You get 100 Gu-coins for free.



Q: If i have 100 gu-coins, why am i not on the list?

A: You have to send or recieve Gu-Coins to be listed



Q: How do i send gu-coins?

A: comment 'give 1 gu-coin' as a reply or part of a reply to any post on r/Nepal

you can also send gucoins using emoji: eg ' ðŸ’©12 ' will send 12 gu-coins

remeber there should be no space between ðŸ’© and amount. so ðŸ’© 12 is incorrect and wont be detected by the bot.

Q: i send gu-coins but it didnt work

A:

Wrong format: make sure its "give [amount] gu-coin" or ðŸ’©[amount]

[amount] has to be an integer (eg. give 25 gu-coin)

you must have more than or equal to what you wish to send

the bot uses the most primitive fucking way of recognising send gu-coin command. So if you use the words 'give' or 'gu-coins' before in your comment, the bot will get confused so yeah for now send gu-coins should be the 1st thing you do:

eg: Good :

give 10 gu-coins because youre so cool man. see how give gu coin part comes 1st in this comment

eg bad:

i will give you 10 gu-coin. give 10 gu-coin. See how i start taking about giving gu coins before 'give 10 gu-coin' command. Thats bad because the bot only looks at the 1st 'give' and 1st 'gu-coin' string.

as you see in the bad example the bot will get confused and not send anything. this can be improved but i'm feeling too lazy rn so maybe in the future.



Q: what can i do with gu-coins?

A: Give it to people. We will also release a feature called Non-Flushable Token soon. You will be able to buy and sell non-flushable token with gu-coin



Q: Is Gu-coin a cryptocurrency?

A: No you dumbass, please learn what a cryptocurrency is/



Q: Can i buy gu-coins for real world money?

A: No. That would be incredibly stupid because gu-coins are literally numbers on a text file. I could make you a millionaire for free if you are polite about it.



Q: Source code?

A: why would i want to show you how poorly i write my code? I am not a professional programmer. More or less a hobbyist. Any way will post the source code in the profile of this bot soon.
